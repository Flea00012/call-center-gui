# This project is an extension of the call center project. It is a simple GUI made inside the sample.fxml file.

## Rationale behind the design 

Here a call center GUI is made that allows the user to make a call to the call center. When the user is logged in, the other buttons for Call escalation and Call handling are not not displayed. When the Call center agent is logged into the system, the call button is not displayed, but the "escalate call" and "take call" buttons are displayed. Furthermore the call center agent has the ability to check status boxes for "on lunch" or "away for the day".
